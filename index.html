                <h2>Good old Fashioned Pancakes</h2>
            </a>
            <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this
                recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>

                <h2>Fluffy French Toast</h2>
            </a>
            <p>This French toast recipe is different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've
                all liked it better than the French toast they usually make!</p>
